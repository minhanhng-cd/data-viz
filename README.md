Welcome to class!

Data Visualization refers to the graphical representation of information and data. It is an extremely important step in Data Analysis as it gives us a much clearer look at our data and help uncover hidden insights.

The most famous library to visualize data in Python is **Matplotlib**. **Matplotlib** is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.

In this session, we will be learning two different styles of creating plots with **Matplotlib** with the developer interview data.

Please refer to [Matplotlib Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/contents.html) for more details.
